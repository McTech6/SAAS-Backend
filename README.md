Project Overview
The platform aims to streamline cybersecurity audits with a focus on ISO 27001 domains. It features a robust user management system with role-based access control (Super Admin, Admin, Auditor), a questionnaire-based audit engine, and comprehensive reporting capabilities (PDF/Excel).

Core Features (MVP)
Audit Engine (Organizational Focus):

Questionnaire-based data collection covering ISO 27001 domains.

Text-based recommendations based on audit responses.

Ability to add comments to answers, with an option to include them in the final report.

Audit responses are specific to each audit instance, preserving original question descriptions.

Dashboard and Reporting:

Visualization of compliance status.

Downloadable audit reports (PDF) and open tasks (Excel).

Score indicators by category/group.

User Management & Access Control:

Role-based access system: Super Admin, Admin, Auditor.

Super Admin can manage Admins and all users.

Admins can manage users under their purview.

MFA and secure authentication (Token-based OTP for registration and login).

User creation by Admin with invite token and email verification flow.

Multilingual Support:

Initially English, designed for scalability to French and German.

Audit Lifecycle Management:

Statuses: "Open", "In Progress", "In Review", "Closed".

Admins can set status to "Closed".

Auditors automatically set status to "In Progress" on first edit, and "In Review" upon completion.

Technology Stack
Runtime: Node.js

Web Framework: Express.js

Database: MongoDB (with Mongoose ODM)

Development Tools: Nodemon

Module System: ES Modules ("type": "module")

Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT), OTP (One-Time Password)

Email/SMS: (To be integrated via specific service providers)

Report Generation: (Libraries for PDF and Excel generation, e.g., pdfkit, exceljs - to be determined)

Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>

Install dependencies:

npm install

Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory based on .env.example.

Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of your project and add the following variables:

PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
OTP_SECRET=your_otp_secret_key
OTP_EXPIRY_MINUTES=10 # Example: OTP expires in 10 minutes

# Email Service (Example using SendGrid or Nodemailer)
EMAIL_SERVICE_HOST=smtp.example.com
EMAIL_SERVICE_PORT=587
EMAIL_SERVICE_USER=your_email_user
EMAIL_SERVICE_PASS=your_email_password
SENDER_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com

# SMS Service (Example using Twilio)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number

Note: Replace placeholder values with your actual credentials and configurations.

Running the Application
To start the development server with Nodemon:

npm run dev

(You will need to add a dev script to your package.json like "dev": "nodemon server.js").

The API will be accessible at http://localhost:<PORT>.

API Endpoints
(This section will be populated as API endpoints are developed, following the Summary of What Is Required_of You.docx document.)

Security Considerations
Password Hashing: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt.

JWT Authentication: Secure token-based authentication.

OTP Verification: Multi-factor authentication for registration and login.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Strict middleware enforces permissions for Super Admin, Admin, and Auditor roles.

Input Validation: All incoming data is validated to prevent common vulnerabilities.

Error Handling: Centralized error handling to prevent sensitive data leakage.

HTTPS: (To be configured in deployment environment).

Future Enhancements
Integration of AI functionalities for enhanced recommendations.

Full multilingual support for French and German.

Advanced dashboard analytics and customizable reports.

Integration with external cybersecurity tools.
